   <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
     concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online.
     PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be
     used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person,

     clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally

     <strong>Third-party disclosure</strong>
     <br /><br />
     We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally
     Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not
     include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our
     website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties
     agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when
     it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or
     protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. <br><br> However, non-personally
     identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing,
     advertising, or other uses.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Third-party links</strong>
     <br /><br />
     Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party
     products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent
     privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and
     activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our
     site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Google</strong>
     <br /><br />
     Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles.
     They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. Visit: <a
       href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en" title="Google
       Adwords Policy"> Google Adwords Policy</a>.
     <br /><br />
     We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.
     <br /><br />
     Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads
     on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users
     based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may
     opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network
     privacy policy.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>We have implemented the following:</strong>
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Remarketing
       with Google AdSense<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Google
       Display Network Impression Reporting<br />

       and Interests Reporting<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> DoubleClick
       Platform Integration
     <br /><br />
     We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party
     cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the
     DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding
     user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to
     our website.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Opting out:</strong>

     opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the
     Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
     <br /><br />
     CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
     websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well
     beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
     the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
     California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
     the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being
     shared. -  See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf"
       title="California Online Privacy Protection Act">California Online Privacy Protection
       Act</a>.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong>
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Users can visit our site
       anonymously.
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Once this privacy policy is
       created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first
       significant page after entering our website.
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Our Privacy Policy link
       includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on evey page.
     <br /><br />
     You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> On our Privacy
     Policy Page
     <br /><br />
     <strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong>
     <br /><br />
     We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
     advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>
     <br /><br />
     It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
     <br /><br />
     When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
     under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
     parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency,
     enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services
     must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
     <br /><br />
     We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13
     years old.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
     <br /><br />
     The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
     privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
     role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
     Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
     with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
       following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong>
     <br /><br />
     We will notify the users via in-site notification
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Within 1
     business day
     <br /><br />
     We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which
     requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
     data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
     not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
     individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
     prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong>
     <br /><br />
     The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial
     email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right
     to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for
     violations.
     <br /><br />
     We do not collect your email address.
